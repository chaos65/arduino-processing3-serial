Linking accelerometer-arduino and processing3 using serial port


This project has an arduino mega 2560 connected to a x-y-z accelerometer on the a0, a1 and a2 analog inputs.

The Arduino is connected to a PC via USB cable.  The Arduino sends back the data to the PC running a Processing3 script where it is displayed graphically in a bar graph.
